          <p>My capstone project in CareerFoundry's UX Immersion course was a responsive web application that enables anyone, anywhere to instantly chat with an expert in virtually any fireld. I chose to target a specific problem that is relevant to many parents and caregivers - nutrition.</p>

        <!-- research div -->
        <div>
          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>To begin, I conducted competitive analysis on websites and apps that focus on nutrition advice for parents. My analysis found that while the parenting advice industry is robust, there are few spaces where parents can connect with an expert directly. Based on this analysis, the goal of Sage is to connect parents and experts directly, at a time that's convenient for them, while also offering evidence-based resources to access any time.</p>
          <p>Next, I moved into defining my research strategy and objectives. Understanding the target audience, their challenges, and how they currently get advice was priority. I created a multiple choice survey and shared it in a variety of parent-centered online communities. The survey was live for two days and received 22 responses.</p>

          </div>
          <p>I conducted user interviews to build personas and to inform the design. I prepared an interview script with 12 open-ended questions. My goal for these interviews was to understand motivation for seeking nutrition advice, document frustrations with the current way nutrition advice is presented and received, and to identify any other challenges faced by the target audience. I recruited and interviewed 4 individuals, all of whom are parents. The interviews were conducted in-person.</p>

        <!-- persona & user flow div -->
        <div>
          <h3>Personas & User Flows</h3>
          <p>In order to form a deeper understanding of Sage users, I used data from the survey and interviews to create two personas, each representing different user types. Personas not only allowed me to empathize with one type of user, but they really represented groups of users, as many parents could relate to these challenges. User Journeys captured their current experience with finding an expert and researching infant nutrition philosophies. These two journeys addressed the first three insights identified in the interviews: accessing nutrition information when convenient, finding a connection with an expert based on specific needs, and a need for the information to be organized and easy to find.</p>

          <p>Now that I understand more about Sage's users, I started to flesh out user stories that would highlight the main features of the app. The user stories were then converted to user flows using LucidChart to illustrate how the user would interact with Sage and accomplish those goals.</p>

          <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
          <p>I conducted an open card sort through OptimalSort and asked participants to sort 20 cards into categories, and then name those categories. Having participants name the categories was helpful in challenging my assumptions as to what titles made sense, and led to navigation that made sense to the user.</p>

        <!-- Ideation div -->
        <div>
          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>My design process began with brainstorming session on the whiteboard, followed by high-level sketches in my notebook. Sketching with pen and paper allowed me to get my ideas down quickly, and to focus on the structure and navigation of the page.</p>
          <div>

            </picture>
          </div>
          <p>From these initial sketches came my low-fidelity wireframes, which helped me to evaluate my user flows. Low-fidelity wireframes helped me see what screens were necessary and what screen were missing from the flow.</p>

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>I created a fully-functional, high-fidelity prototype of the new flows using Figma. At the same time, prepared a test plan and started recruiting participants that fit the criteria. I conducted 6 usability tests, 3 in-person and 3 remotely via Zoom.</p>

          </div>
          <p>I used Affinity Mapping to synthesize the data and identify common issues and errors in the prototype. I used the Nielson/Norman scale to rank the severity of observed errors and pain points and to prioritize changes in future iterations.</p>

          <p>Once the usability issues were resolved, I moved on to design the final screens in Figma. My goal was to create a visual identity that’s aligned with the Sage's mission to provide expert advice and evidence-based nutrition resources.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sage's primary color evokes imperssions of natural, health, balance, and food</li>
            <li>Sage must be professional, friendly, and welcoming</li>
            <li>Material Design guidelines were followed for all UI</li>
            <li>Layout was designed on an 8-point grid for consistency</li>

            <li>Refine Visual Design - continue working on UI and visual design, refining the resources section so that the look and feel of content presented resonates with Sage users.</li>
            <li>Explore Opportunities - Explore the business side of Sage such as the viability, how to launch, and free vs. paid memberships. Content is key to Sage, so will also explore how that can be generated, whether through expert partnerships, the Sage community, or both.</li>
